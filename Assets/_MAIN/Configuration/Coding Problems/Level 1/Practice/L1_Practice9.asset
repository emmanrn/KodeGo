  hints:
  - Since a single backslash has a special meaning to Python, you must use two backslashes
    (\\) before the 'new_floder' so it prints correctly.
  - We use '\\' so that we can print one '\' because using only one backslash is
    a special meaning already in Python used for the '\n' and maybe even more
