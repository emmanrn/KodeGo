NPC as npc1 "In Python, every line of code is like a sentence — write it clearly, and the computer will understand you."
NPC as npc1 "Indentation isn’t just neatness — it tells Python which code belongs together."
NPC as npc1 "Python doesn’t use curly braces or semicolons. Just clean lines and proper spacing."
NPC as npc1 "Try using print() to speak to the terminal. It’s Python’s way of saying something out loud!"
NPC as npc1 "Don’t forget: Python reads your code top to bottom, one line at a time."
NPC as npc1 "Comments are your secret notes. Type # to write reminders that Python will ignore."
NPC as npc1 "The computer follows your syntax exactly — one missing parenthesis, and it gets confused!"
NPC as npc1 "Let’s start simple. Make Python say hello — and it will say it proudly!"

NPC as guide "Remember: even the smallest error can break the biggest idea."
NPC as guide [0:A12]"So, keep your code clean, your mind clear, and your print() ready."
